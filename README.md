# amazon_sentiment_analysis
*(Based on materials prepared for Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach, Coursera by University of Washington).*

Building classifiers, applying them to analyzing product sentiment, and understanding the types of errors 
a classifier makes using amazon products reviews. 

###Results:    
- training a sentiment analysis model using a set of key polarizing words 
- verifying the weights learned to each of these words
- comparing the results of this simpler classifier with those of the one using all of the words


###Outcomes

Execute sentiment analysis code with the IPython notebook   
Load and transform real, text data    
Using the .apply() function to create new columns (features) for our model    
Compare results of two models, one using all words and the other using a subset of the words    
Compare learned models with majority class prediction   
Examine the predictions of a sentiment model    
Build a sentiment analysis model using a classifier
